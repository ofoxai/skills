#!/usr/bin/env bash
# imagecost.test.sh — the computed dollar cost of an image generation.
#
# The image endpoint returns no cost of its own, and Ofox exposes no billing
# endpoint to look one up (every /v1 and /v2 usage, billing, credits, account
# and balance path answers 404). So the figure is computed here from the
# published rates and the response's own token counts, and the only thing
# that makes it trustworthy is that it was checked against a real invoice.
#
# The anchor case below is that invoice: a call reporting input_tokens=79,
# output_tokens=1120 was billed $0.06723950 on 2026-08-31. It settles a
# question the model page could not — whether image output tokens bill at
# $60/M or $3/M, a 20x difference. If this case ever stops matching, the
# formula has drifted from what is actually charged, and the skill is
# quoting fiction.
#
# Free by construction: rates come from the public, keyless model list (or
# the bundled snapshot when offline), and nothing here submits a request.
#
# Run: bash references/test/imagecost.test.sh
