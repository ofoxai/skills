# OFOX_API_KEY is read from the shell environment. This script never parses a

#   ofox-video.sh providers [MODEL]   (local/public, no API key)
#   ofox-video.sh generate --prompt "..." [OPTIONS]

#   --model NAME              default: bytedance/seedance-2.5. This skill has a
#                               default because every scenario built on it
#                               targets Seedance 2.5 specifically; the sibling
#                               ofox-image-core deliberately has none, because
#                               its models differ ~4x in price with no obvious
#                               winner. Run 'models' to see the alternatives —
#                               seedance-2.0-mini is ~5x cheaper for drafts.
#   --prompt TEXT             required
#   --duration N               seconds. Validated against the chosen model's
#                               own range (Seedance 2.5: 4-30, Wan 2.x: 2-15,
#                               HappyHorse: 3-15, Seedance 2.0*: 4-15).
#   --resolution VAL            validated per model, e.g. 480p | 720p | 1080p
#                               for Seedance 2.5; 720p | 1080p for Wan 2.x.
#                               Run 'ofox-video.sh models' to see each one.
#   --aspect-ratio VAL          validated per model, e.g. 21:9 | 16:9 | 4:3 |
#                               1:1 | 3:4 | 9:16 | adaptive for Seedance 2.5;
#                               16:9 | 9:16 | 1:1 for Wan 2.x.
#   --provider SLUG             pin the upstream. Defaults to byteplus for
#                               bytedance/seedance-* (Ofox otherwise routes by
#                               weight and which upstream serves a request is
#                               not predictable). 'auto' sends no pin. Also
#                               settable via OFOX_VIDEO_PROVIDER. Pricing is
#                               identical across upstreams — this is a region
#                               and moderation choice, not a cost one.
#   --dry-run                   validate, resolve the provider, build the
#                               payload and print the cost estimate, then stop
#                               WITHOUT submitting. Nothing is billed. Use this
#                               to quote a price to someone before spending.
#   --print-payload             dump the request body to stderr before sending
#                               (the API key is in a header, not the body)
#   --name TEXT                 short, human-readable name for the output file,
#                               e.g. "convenience store breakup". The file lands
#                               as <name>-<short job id>.mp4 with a matching
#                               .json sidecar. Without it the name is derived
#                               from the prompt, which still beats a bare job id
#                               but reads worse — a caller that knows what the
#                               shot is should say so. Sanitized before use.
#   --size WxH                  e.g. 1280x720 (alternative to --resolution)
#   --generate-audio true|false default: true (server-side default)
#   --seed N                    recorded and re-submittable, NOT reproducible:
#                               an identical request on a fixed seed has been
#                               measured returning a different clip.
#   --frame-first-image URL|PATH image-to-video: first frame. Accepts a remote
#                               http(s):// URL (used as-is) or a local,
#                               readable file path (base64-encoded into a
#                               data: URI automatically). Attaching a frame
#                               affects aspect_ratio: on
#                               bytedance/seedance-2.5 (the default model) it
#                               is FORCED to adaptive, overriding
#                               --aspect-ratio, because the API requires it;
#                               on any other model that lists adaptive it is
#                               only the DEFAULT when you passed no
#                               --aspect-ratio, and an explicit ratio is kept
#                               as you wrote it. Every one of those paths
#                               prints a notice — none of them is silent.
#   --frame-last-image URL|PATH  image-to-video: last frame (same URL/local
#                               file support and aspect_ratio behavior)
#   --real-person true|false
#   --callback-url URL          must be https://
#   --extra-json JSON           merged into the request body as-is (advanced:
#                               input_references, provider, etc.)
#   --out-dir DIR                default: current directory
#   --max-wait SECONDS           default: 540 (9 minutes)
#   --poll-interval SECONDS      default: 6
#
# batch / poll OPTIONS:
#   --concurrency N             how many jobs to WAIT for at once. Default 4,
#                               ceiling 10, also settable via
#                               OFOX_POLL_CONCURRENCY. A polling job issues one
#                               request per --poll-interval, so at the default
#                               6s each one spends 10 of the account's measured
#                               100 requests/minute: 4 is 40% of the budget, 10
#                               is all of it. Submission is never concurrent —
#                               see cmd_batch's header for why.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success — job completed, video downloaded
#   1  usage / parameter validation error (no network call made)
#   2  environment error (missing curl/jq/OFOX_API_KEY)
#   3  API rejected the request, or the job ended failed/cancelled/expired
#   4  timed out waiting for a terminal state — the job is still running
#      upstream. Re-run: ofox-video.sh poll JOB_ID  (batch and a multi-id poll
#      return this only when nothing worse happened: a take that FAILED after
#      submission is exit 3, since a failure needs a new prompt and a timeout
#      needs another poll.)
#      Do NOT re-run 'generate' for the same request — that creates a
#      duplicate, separately billed job.
#   5  the create call had an ambiguous network failure (no HTTP response was
#      received at all). We cannot tell whether the job was created
#      server-side. Do not auto-retry create — check https://app.ofox.ai
#      first, then retry manually only if nothing was created.
#   6  --out-dir could not be created or entered (bad path, permissions).
#      This is a local filesystem problem, not an API problem — if it
#      happened during 'generate', the job may already exist server-side
#      (or still be running). Do NOT re-run 'generate'; fix --out-dir and
#      re-run: ofox-video.sh poll JOB_ID --out-dir <a writable directory>
#
# No-resubmit rule: once a create call gets a response (any HTTP status),
# this script never issues a second create call for the same invocation. If
# polling is slow, times out, or a poll request itself errors, the fix is to
# retry the POLL, never the CREATE. See the 'poll' subcommand.

# Upstream providers. Ofox routes a multi-upstream model by weight and says
# outright that "which provider serves any single request is not predictable".
# For Seedance that alternates between BytePlus (outside mainland China) and
# Volcengine Ark (mainland), which moderate differently — so the same prompt
# can pass one run and be rejected the next with nothing to point at.
#
# Measured 2026-08-30 via the public catalog endpoint: all four
# bytedance/seedance-* are served by byteplus + volcengine; all four alibaba/*
# by aliyun alone. We pin Seedance to byteplus and leave everything else alone:
# with a single upstream, weighted routing is already deterministic, so pinning
# would change nothing while adding a hardcoded fact that can rot.
#
# Re-measured 2026-09-14, and the fact rotted exactly as predicted. Every
# alibaba/* model now reports TWO upstreams (alicloud + aliyun), and the two
# minimax/hailuo-3* models added since report minimax + novita. So the
# "single upstream, nothing to pin" rationale above no longer holds for
# alibaba/* — those requests route by weight today and are not pinned.
# Deliberately left that way here: whether the two alibaba upstreams differ
# behaviourally has not been measured, and pinning on an unmeasured guess is
# what this comment already warns against. Tracked with the hailuo-3 pinning
# question (Fizzy #841).
#
# Pricing was identical across upstreams on 2026-08-30 (verified tier by
# tier), and that is ALSO no longer universally true: alibaba/wan-3.0 prices
# alicloud at 0.11/s and aliyun at 0.0857/s for 720p, a 28% spread. Every
# other model still matches across its upstreams. rate_for() prefers the
# pinned provider's card for this reason; when nothing is pinned it takes the
# first card, which for wan-3.0 happens to be the dearer one — the safe
# direction per "never under-quote", but by array order, not by design. Do not
# "simplify" the pinned-card preference away.
#
# This list is the global set of slugs the script will accept at all; whether
# a given slug serves a given model is checked separately against the catalog
# below. alicloud and novita were missing here until 2026-09-14, so `providers
# MODEL` printed upstreams that `--provider` then refused.

         contact-sheet/last-frame/frame-at/mux-audio are local ffmpeg work:
         no API call, no key, no cost

Downloads are named <slug>-<short job id>.<ext>, where the slug comes from
--name or, without it, from the prompt. Each video gets a .json sidecar
holding the full job id, the prompt and the cost — the short id in the
filename cannot be expanded back on its own.

Independent clips are waited for in parallel, not one after another: give
'poll' every job id at once, or let 'batch' do it for its takes. --concurrency
caps how many are polled simultaneously (default 4, ceiling 10 — 10 polls at
the default 6s interval is already the whole measured 100 requests/minute
account limit). Submission stays sequential so a rejected create still stops a
batch before the remaining takes are paid for.

Seedance jobs are pinned to the byteplus upstream by default; override with
--provider volcengine, or --provider auto to let Ofox route by weight. Run
'providers' to see a model's upstreams. Pricing is identical across them.

Run with no arguments for this message. See the top of this file, or
skills/ofox-video-core/SKILL.md and references/api-params.md, for the full
option list and parameter reference.

  #     research): every other value fails once frame_images is attached, so
  #     it is forced even over a ratio the caller passed explicitly. Matched
  #     on the catalog's canonical id, so the documented aliases ('seedance-2.5')
  #     get the same treatment as the full id.
  #   Any other model that lists 'adaptive' merely SUPPORTS it. There it is
  #     the right default when the caller named no ratio — without it the
  #     attached frame's shape may not be honoured, and you only find that
  #     out after paying for the clip — but an explicit ratio is a choice
  #     this model never demanded, so overriding it would be overreach.
  #

  # validation above already read (video_attributes.aspect_ratios), never
  # from a second hardcoded model list. When no entry was available
  # model_aspects is empty and nothing is added: fail open rather than invent

# batch: N takes of one prompt, real per-take billing, optional contact sheet
#
# Generating several takes and keeping one is how this actually gets used, and
# it is the thing nobody prices honestly. So: estimate before spending, report
# what each take really cost from its own usage.video_cost, and total it.
#
# Every take is its own job, created one at a time through the same
# cmd_generate path a single generate uses (in its submit-only mode). That
# keeps the no-resubmit rule intact for free — nothing here can re-POST a
# request that already exists — and it means a take benefits from every
# validation and error mapping the single-shot path already has.
#
# The two halves are deliberately different:
#
#   submit  SEQUENTIAL. A create answers in seconds, so serialising it costs
#           almost no wall clock, and it is what makes the money guard exact:
#           if take 2's create is rejected, takes 3..N are never sent.
#   wait    CONCURRENT, up to --concurrency at a time. This is the ten-minute
#           half. One 15s 720p job measured over 600s of wall clock on
#           2026-09-05, so three takes serially is half an hour for work the
#           API does in ten minutes. The account allows 100 RPM and a polling
#           job spends 10 of them, so nothing about the rate limit required
#           the old serial wait.
#
# A take that fails to SUBMIT stops the run: whatever broke take 2's create
# will almost certainly break takes 3..N, and continuing would spend real
# money to collect identical failures. Takes already submitted are still
# waited for and downloaded — they are billable whether or not we collect
# them, and abandoning a paid job is not a saving.
#
# A take that fails AFTER submission (a generation-time or moderation failure)
# is a different animal: the money is already committed and the other takes
# are already running, so it is reported and the rest complete normally.

# chain: N shots, each opening on the previous shot's closing frame
#
# One job is one 4-30s clip, and a clip CAN hold several shots joined by hard
# cuts written as timestamps (verified 2026-09-03 — see "Several shots in one
# job" in references/prompt-structure.md). So this subcommand is not "the way
# to get multiple shots": it is continuity ACROSS jobs, for a sequence past the
# duration ceiling or when each shot needs its own approval, seed or
# resolution. Separate jobs share nothing, so the character, set and lighting
# drift between them; feeding shot N-1's last frame in as shot N's first frame
# is the lever this API gives you against that. The two compose — each job in a
# chain can itself carry several timestamped shots.
#
# Same house rules as batch: estimate before spending, one job at a time via
# cmd_generate (no-resubmit holds for free), stop on first failure, report real
# per-job cost.

# meaningful name instead of degrading to a raw job id. Prints nothing when
# there is no usable source, which is the caller's signal to fall back to the
# job id.
#
# Slicing happens in jq, not bash. jq slices by codepoint and is
# locale-independent, so a CJK prompt can never be cut mid-character the way
# `cut -b` would, and the result doesn't change under LC_ALL=C. jq is already
# a hard dependency of this script, so this costs no new requirement.
#
# Both sources are untrusted text that becomes part of a path: a --name comes
# from a calling skill, and a prompt comes from whoever wrote it. Path
# separators, characters illegal on Windows filesystems, and control
# characters are stripped, then any non-alphanumeric run is trimmed off both
# ends, so '../../etc/passwd' cannot survive as anything traversable, nothing
# turns into a hidden file or a leading-dash pseudo-flag, and a name never
# trails a stray comma or full stop where the slice happened to land. Han
# characters count as alphanumeric here, so CJK text survives while CJK
# punctuation is trimmed.

  # control characters are stripped, because tab and newline are both: strip

  # of separating into words. And the slice comes before the final trim,
  # because the slice itself can land on a separator and leave a trailing
  # dash.
  #
  # Control characters are matched with the POSIX class [[:cntrl:]], never
