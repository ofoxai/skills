# handoff.test.sh — the seed, and the create -> poll request handoff.
#
# Both exist for one reason: making a generated shot reproducible. The API
# echoes neither resolution, aspect ratio nor seed on a poll, so what the
# sidecar knows is whatever the client recorded at create time — and create
# and poll are separate processes, so that record has to survive on disk.
#
# Free by construction: no network at all. The handoff helpers are file
# operations, and download_result() is driven with a synthetic body whose
# download URL is a local file:// path. The API base still points at an
# unroutable address so that any accidental request fails instead of
# reaching a real endpoint.
#
# Run: bash references/test/handoff.test.sh
