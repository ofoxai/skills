# Free by construction, and more strongly than the suites that point at an
# unroutable address: nothing here touches the network at all. The slug
# builder is a pure function, and download_result() is driven with a
# synthetic response body whose download URL is a local file:// path, so the
# "download" is a file copy. No API base is ever contacted, billable or not.
#
# Sourcing note: the script ends in `main "$@"` / `exit $?`, so it is loaded
# with that tail stripped. That is the only way to reach the internal
# functions; the alternative — exercising naming through the CLI — would
# require a real completed job, which costs money.
#
# Run: bash references/test/naming.test.sh
