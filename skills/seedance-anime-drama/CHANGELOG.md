# Changelog

All notable changes to the **seedance-anime-drama** skill. Versioning follows SemVer.

This file starts at 1.0.2; earlier versions predate it.

## 1.1.0 — jobs are pinned to the byteplus upstream

**Behavior change, inherited from ofox-video-core 1.4.0.** Jobs now go to the
`byteplus` upstream (ByteDance's platform for markets outside mainland China)
instead of wherever Ofox's weighted routing sent them. The two upstreams
moderate differently and routing was explicitly unpredictable, so the same
prompt could pass one run and be rejected the next. Pass `--provider
volcengine` for the mainland platform or `--provider auto` for the old
behavior. Pricing is identical either way.

No change to prompts or defaults otherwise.

## 1.0.2 — ClawHub frontmatter

- Frontmatter now carries a top-level `version` and
  `metadata.openclaw.homepage`/`envVars`/`primaryEnv`. ClawHub's publish
  scanner reads those, not `metadata.version` or the top-level `homepage`
  this skill already had.
- No change to prompts, defaults, or behavior.

### Inherited from ofox-video-core 1.2.0 and ofox-image-core 1.1.0

This skill delegates execution to both cores, so it picks up their fixes for
free:

- Per-model video validation: a bad `--duration`/`--resolution`/
  `--aspect-ratio` for the chosen model is caught locally with that model's own
  legal values named, instead of costing a round trip.
- The character-reference-image step can now use any image model Ofox serves,
  not just the three that used to be hardcoded — `google/gemini-3-pro-image`
  and `volcengine/doubao-seedream-5.0-pro` among them.
