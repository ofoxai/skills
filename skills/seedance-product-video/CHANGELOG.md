# Changelog

All notable changes to the **seedance-product-video** skill. Versioning follows SemVer.

This file starts at 1.0.2; earlier versions predate it.

## 1.5.0 — tell people they can get a price without signing up

- New section: `models`, `providers` and `--dry-run` all work with no API key,
  so quote the job first and point at signup second. Opening with "go get an
  API key" asks someone to register before they know what it costs.
- New troubleshooting entry for
  `bash: ../ofox-video-core/…: No such file or directory` — it means the core
  skill isn't installed alongside this one, not that anything is broken. That
  raw error names neither the missing skill nor the fix, and a non-programmer
  reads it as "this is broken".

## 1.4.0 — exit codes, timeouts, contact sheets, and showing the prompt

Follow-up to `ofox-video-core` 1.8.0, closing gaps a second role-play review
found in this skill specifically:

- **Exit codes are listed here now.** This skill pointed at
  `references/api-params.md` for them; that file only has the `error.code`
  table, so an agent looking up exit 6 found nothing where it was sent.
- **Timeout guidance.** `generate` can block nine minutes, longer than a
  default agent tool call allows. Names `create` + `poll` as the way out, and
  the `takes x max-wait` arithmetic for `batch`.
- **Duration expectations**, so the wait isn't silent for the user.
- **Hand over the `CONTACT_SHEET` path.** In a batch flow it is the artifact
  the user looks at first, and this skill never said to give it to them.
- **Per-take seeds** are now reported by `batch`, which makes "take 3 was the
  good one, render it properly" a real command instead of a reroll.
- **Show the prompt, not just the price.** The user is paying for the prompt;
  a clip that costs exactly what was quoted and shows a character they never
  pictured is still a wasted job.

## 1.3.0 — quote before spending, and stop littering the user's repo

Rewrites the cost and delivery guidance around `ofox-video-core` 1.7.0's new
`--dry-run`. Previously this skill told the agent to relay an estimate that
the script only prints once the job is already billable — following it
literally billed the user with no warning.

- Cost flow is now: `--dry-run` to quote, wait for a yes, re-run without it.
- **`--out-dir` in every example.** This skill never mentioned it, and the
  script defaults to the current directory — so an agent copying an example
  dropped a bare-UUID mp4 into the user's project root.
- **`batch` is documented here now.** "Give me a few to choose from" is a
  normal request, and this skill previously offered no path to it but running
  `generate` repeatedly: no batch total, no contact sheet, no stop-on-failure.
  Includes the draft-cheap-then-render-expensive ladder.
- Quote `BATCH_COST_TOTAL`, not `BATCH_COST_PER_TAKE`.
- Report costs as money, not as the raw ten-decimal string.
- States how the relative script path resolves, instead of leaving it to the
  core skill's documentation.

## 1.2.0 — multi-shot product sequences

Documents `ofox-video-core` 1.6.0's `chain`: each shot opens on the previous
shot's closing frame, so the product keeps its position and lighting across
cuts, and the shots are joined into one file. Applies here because the
real-person restriction that blocks chaining live-action sequences does not
apply to objects.

## 1.1.1 — cost guidance uses the script's own estimate

`ofox-video.sh` now prints a cost estimate before submitting, read from live
rates. This skill's guidance no longer tells the agent to compute one by hand
from a table that can go stale — relay the printed figure, and if it says the
estimate is unavailable, say that rather than substituting a number.

## 1.1.0 — jobs are pinned to the byteplus upstream

**Behavior change, inherited from ofox-video-core 1.4.0.** Jobs now go to the
`byteplus` upstream (ByteDance's platform for markets outside mainland China)
instead of wherever Ofox's weighted routing sent them. The two upstreams
moderate differently and routing was explicitly unpredictable, so the same
prompt could pass one run and be rejected the next. Pass `--provider
volcengine` for the mainland platform or `--provider auto` for the old
behavior. Pricing is identical either way.

No change to prompts or defaults otherwise.

## 1.0.2 — ClawHub frontmatter

- Frontmatter now carries a top-level `version` and
  `metadata.openclaw.homepage`/`envVars`/`primaryEnv`. ClawHub's publish
  scanner reads those, not `metadata.version` or the top-level `homepage`
  this skill already had.
- No change to prompts, defaults, or behavior.

### Inherited from ofox-video-core 1.2.0

This skill delegates execution, so it picks up per-model parameter validation
for free: a bad `--duration`/`--resolution`/`--aspect-ratio` for the chosen
model is now caught locally, with that model's own legal values named, instead
of costing a round trip to come back as a generic `invalid_request`.
